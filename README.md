Responsive restaurant website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Excited to share my latest project! Iâ€™ve designed and developed a sleek, responsive restaurant website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From user-friendly navigation to visually appealing layouts, this website perfectly showcases the restaurant's menu and ambiance. Ready to bring more ideas to life!
